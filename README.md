# Twitter_EDA_and_Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to gain insights into the dataset, understand the sentiment behind tweets, and explore various features and patterns within the data.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis consists of Twitter data collected from a specific time period. Full tweet texts are provided with their labels for training data. The link for the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section focuses on gaining a better understanding of the dataset and its characteristics. It includes:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicate entries, and transforming data types if necessary.
- Descriptive Statistics: Computing basic statistics such as count, mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize the data.
- Visualizations: Creating various plots, such as histograms, bar charts, and word clouds, to visualize the distribution of data, explore patterns, and identify trends.
## Sentiment Analysis
The Sentiment Analysis section aims to determine the sentiment expressed in each tweet. It involves the following steps:

- Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the tweet text by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs. Performing tokenization and stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.
- Sentiment Scoring: Assigning a sentiment score to each tweet using pre-trained sentiment analysis models or lexicons. Common approaches include the use of machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines, or the application of sentiment lexicons like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
- Sentiment Visualization: Creating visualizations, such as sentiment distribution plots or sentiment over time plots, to understand the overall sentiment pattern and changes across different time periods or user groups.
